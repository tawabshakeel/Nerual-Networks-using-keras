Different Neural Networks using keras

A blog from where I get details of different Neural Networks [A blog By andrewtch](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-mostly-complete-chart-of-neural-networks-explained-3fb6f2367464)

| Project | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`Perceptron`](https://github.com/tawabshakeel/Nerual-Networks-using-keras/tree/master/perceptron) | Most simple Neural Network. Takes some inputs, sums them up, applies activation function and passes them to output layer . |
| [`Feed Forward`](https://github.com/tawabshakeel/Nerual-Networks-using-keras/tree/master/feed%20forward) | Quite old Neural Network. All nodes are connected, Activation function is applied , Only  one hidden layer | 
[Deep Feed Forwrd neural network]() | Coming Soon.
